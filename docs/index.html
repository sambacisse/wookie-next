How would I prevent my ISP from selling details about my shopping habits and personal preferences to the highest bidder?\n\n### Why DNS and why should you care?\n\nStandards for encrypting web traffic have become widely adopted since their introduction in the late 90s. It's not my first day, so I knew that content sent over HTTPS would be difficult (but not impossible) for a third party to do much with, and I already use HTTPS-everywhere and Brave to help keep things on the up-and-up. Unfortunately, even exclusively using HTTPS doesn't mean that 100% of your traffic is encrypted and secure.\n\nA crucially important part of how your computer or phone loads a website is completely unencrypted in practice. The Domain Name System, or DNS, is how your web browser knows how to find the domain \"google.com\" when you type `https://www.google.com` into your browser's address bar, and DNS isn't normally encrypted. Anyone who handles the traffic can take a peek if they're so inclined.\n\n\u003e Ability plus incentive makes for easy temptation. DNS is an easy target if your ISP wanted to profit from a complete list of the websites you visited.\n\nEven worse, an ISP could resolve a DNS entry for a different website altogether or send you to a \"toll booth\" captive portal for whatever nefarious reasons they could think of.\n\nWhich means that even if I took every reasonable precaution and always made sure `https` was in the URL when buying John Tesh cd's on Amazon, watching John Tesh videos on Youtube, or posting updates to my John Tesh fanzine, Comcast would still be able to see the URLs of the pages and sell them to anyone who cared. That is unacceptable. My secret love of John Tesh is too precious for a greedy corporate entity to harvest for profits.\n\n\u003ca href=\"/static/img/the-cyber.jpg\"\u003e\n  \u003cimg src=\"/static/img/the-cyber.jpg\"\n    class=\"w-60-l w-50-m w-100 ml3-ns fr-ns mt1 mb2 pa1 br1 ba b--rainbows\" /\u003e\n\u003c/a\u003e\n\nGood thing for me, a bunch of smart folks who are well versed in \"the cyber\" had already thought this one through enough to write RFC standards for the DNS protocol that can make it much harder for a third party to see the paper trail of domains and URLs left by a furious session of John Tesh related browsing. Even better, these standards have been implemented with open source and are available to use for free, without too much overhead.\n\nUnfortunately, encrypting your DNS isn't yet as ubiquitous or widely support as HTTPS, so there are still a few hoops to jump through if you want to start obfuscating this aspect of your web traffic.\n\nIt's also important to note that encrypting your DNS isn't a silver bullet with regards to online privacy. True privacy is a fleeting concept, or at least one that's impossible to make sane guarantees about. Like any encryption technology, it's only as strong as the implementation being used, and in recent years those have been known to be compromised with some degree of regularity. Even when you're encrypting your communications doesn't mean you should automatically trust the person on the other end of the line. Not to sound paranoid, but be careful about who you place blind trust in and always look before you leap.\n\n### Enter DNSCrypt\n\nDNSCrypt is a great collection of software tools that let you get up and running with encrypted DNS really quickly. Don't take my word of it. Head over to dnscrypt.org for comprehensive info about what it is and all the ways you can use it.\n\n\u003e dnscrypt + httpseverywhere is 9/10s of a vpn imo\n\n\u003cp class=\"w-100 tr\"\u003e\n‚Äî \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/SlexAxton/status/853715217058025475\"\u003eAlex Sexton, notable person on the internet\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\nDNSCrypt is a way to run an encrypted dns server and clients for every platform to connect with it. There are already plenty of servers around the world that you can connect to out-of-the-box with a gui clients, so getting up and running is super easy. And there are plenty of command line tools, too. Everything is open source and the community seems active, with multiple projects to choose from for most layers of tooling.\n\nThe client apps work by changing your network settings to use a dns server running DNSCrypt, and lets you quickly switch back and forth between your previous \"normal\" dns and an encrypted configuration. It does this by running a local dns server on your computer, which handles one end of the encryption and decryption, with the public server you're connecting with on the other end. Since all the traffic is encrypted on your computer before it's sent to the server, an intermediary like your ISP can't see the domain being requested.\n\n### What's the catch? Why isn't this everywhere already?\n\nThe catch is that ultimately your dns request will be served from an unencrypted (but authenticated) channel because the global network of DNS servers does not implement the DNSCrypt protocol.\n\n### First steps\n\nBetter instructions here, obvs: https://dnscrypt.org/\n\nInstall the [dnscrypt-client](https://github.com/alterstep/dnscrypt-osxclient) and connect to one of the public nodes. I chose https://nxt.ist. You can \"trust\" these because they issue keypairs or something(?) but, caveat emptor.\n\nBut roll with the thick client because it's convenient and you'll get to see what you're in for... which is pretty boring if you're not running `dig` or `nslookup` all the time to see where your DNS entries are coming from. But then again, it's pretty boring. But at least they're encrypted?\n\n### Paranoid mode: Roll your own DNSCrypt server\n\nI chose a droplet that came with Ubuntu 16.04 and Docker 1.17 pre-installed. Created a new keypair (always, always create a new keypair) and give it a good name, a static IPv4 address, and an IPv6 address if you hate yourself (or want to learn about docker's nightmare factory networking layer).\n\nSSH to the server and fire up the [DNSCrypt Server Docker Image](https://github.com/jedisct1/dnscrypt-server-docker) with the instructions from the README:\n\n```bash\ndocker run --name=dnscrypt-server -p 443:443/udp -p 443:443/tcp \\\n    jedisct1/unbound-dnscrypt-server init -N example.com\n\ndocker start dnscrypt\n```\n\nThe first command returns a public key. You'll need this. It's also in your docker logs if you forget it `docker logs dnscrypt-server | head`.\n\nNow you have a server running, note the IP and setup a client to connect to it.\n\n### Connecting clients with dnscrypt-proxy\n\nI tried 2 ways of connecting devices to my new dnscrypt server from my local network.\n\n\u003cb\u003e1 - Run the proxy client everywhere\u003c/b\u003e\n\nRun dnscrypt-proxy on every device where you want encrypted dns, which makes a local dns server which sends encrypted requests to your server. This is the \"safest\" way of doing things because you're not trusting anyone else to do the encryption for you, making it a bit more difficult for someone to spy on your dns traffic.\n\nInstall it for mac with homebrew: `brew install dnscrypt-proxy`\n\nThen connect to your server using the IP and public key:\n\n```\nsudo dnscrypt-proxy --provider-key=YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY \\\n  --resolver-address=YOUR_IPv4_ADDRESS:443 \\\n  --provider-name=2.dnscrypt-cert.example.com\n```\n\nNow edit your DNS settings to point at your IP. This is actually really convenient if you're already using dnscrypt-client: in the \"Advanced\" tab, add your IP to the field labeled \"When not using DNSCrypt, use the following static DNS servers\". Now, when you turn off the DNSCrypt thick client, it will try to use the proxy you started from the command line.\n\nIt's a pain in the ass that you can't point to your own server on the client. There, I said it. Pull requests welcome, I guess?\n\n\u003cb\u003e2 - Run it from one place on your local network\u003c/b\u003e\n\nRun dnscrypt-proxy somewhere on your local network, and tell devices to use that as their source of truth for dns. If you trust your local network (which, depending on how many IOT devices you have running or you don't control router/modem settings, might not be a good idea,) then you can avoid extra process overhead and it works for phones and tablets.\n\nBasically the same steps as above, but make sure that you start the dnscrypt-proxy client with `--local-address=0.0.0.0` so that it broadcasts to your network.\n\nAnd, uh, make sure your router doesn't liberally port forward or you'll live to regret it.\n\nI did this on my ubuntu media server and I ran into dnsmasq issues, because ubuntu is stupid and runs a dnsmasq process as part of it's network stack, but it's not the \"real\" dnsmasq so you can't configure it to broadcast (go figure).\n\nTo get everything working without just nuking the unconfigurable dnsmasq process, I had to run dnscrypt-proxy on another port, `127.0.0.1:40` and then install the \"real\" dnsmasq, `sudo apt-get install dnsmasq` and tell it to use dnscrypt-proxy as a nameserver. All this is from here, conveniently: https://wiki.debian.org/HowTo/dnsmasq\n\n```\nno-resolv\nserver 127.0.0.1\n```\n\nThen I switched all the dns settings on my phones and computers to point at the local ip of my media server for DNS, falling back to google's `8.8.8.8` and `8.8.4.4` to avoid being inconveninced if the process dies.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n\u003cdiv class=\"fr-ns w-50-ns w-100 ml3-ns tc tl-ns bonzi-buddy\"\u003e\n  \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BonziBuddy\"\n    target=\"__blank\" class=\"none\"\u003e\n    \u003cimg src=\"/static/img/bonzi-buddy.gif\" class=\"pa1\" /\u003e\n  \u003c/a\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\nEncrypting DNS is boring, but satisfying.\n\nHappy Hacking ü§ì\n\n\u003cdiv class=\"cf\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n","permalink":"writing/protect-your-history.html","title":"Protect Your Browsing History with DNSCrypt","updatedAt":"2017-04-23T04:09:44.000Z"},{"slug":"what-I-read-in-2016","path":"src/posts/what-I-read-in-2016.md","body":"## Why I Read What I Read in 2016\n\n\nJanuary 1, 2017\n\nI tried to read more this year, I really did.

Probably around the second half of 2015 enough static had built up around the problem to trigger a release, a single spasm of output into list form, tapped diligently onto the keyboard of my iPhone. That list, of things I was currently reading and thing I remembered reading up to that point in the year and books I had already purchased and were waiting for me on my bookshelf, was what source my 2015 post, which I still wrote in a hurry on New Year‚Äôs Day 2016.\n\nI kept up the practice of maintaining a reading list in Wunderlist. It unfurled itself ahead of me and pushed the past books forever below the fold. I got ambitious a couple of times and added dozens of titles, so many in fact that the list became a burden. I couldn‚Äôt look at it. And the format, for however much it rewarded me with the initial thrill of checking off a title, downplayed the previous items in a way that was a little unsatisfying. I had also taken to using Wunderlist (which I love, btw, despite the criticism) for work task tracking, so it became a thing that now did two things, which is far to many functions for my limbic brain to remember how to reward. So I let that list wither a little until finally I abandoned it entirely.\n\nThat‚Äôs when I finally re-did my website and by doing a classic thing-you-shouldn‚Äôt-do and rolled my own publishing software from scratch. Mostly so I could maintain a list in markdown, which, I kinda did?\n\nLast year‚Äôs was a Medium post. Medium is great. I‚Äôm mad jellz of what they built. But I like writing in thick app, and I like writing in markdown, and I like being able to keep and move around my own files.\u003csup\u003e1\u003c/sup\u003e\n\nSo I once again went through the act of translating my reading history from Wunderlist into a more sharable format. Hence the list you‚Äôll find archived at the bottom of this post.\u003csup\u003e2\u003c/sup\u003e\n\n## How to read this list:\n\nBecause decisions are hard, I‚Äôve gone through the trouble of preparing a few variations:\n\n1. The ‚ÄúClassic‚Äù list, as maintained in earlier versions of this post. If you don‚Äôt like introspective bullshit, skip to this one ‚Äî [Classic List](2016-reading-list.html)\n2. The Esoteric List, my first thoughts on how to properly formulate a wrap up post that sums up my life this year ‚Äî [Esoteric](#so-you-like-books-huh-)\n3. Up / down recommendations, my no frills recommendations: read it or skip it ‚Äî [Up/Down](#up-down)\n\nI now present these, out of order:\n\n## So you like books, huh?\n\nFuck man, this was a hell of a year, wasn‚Äôt it? I‚Äôve probably said that exact phrase a couple of dozen times in the waning days of 2016. But, fuck, man, wasn‚Äôt it tho?\n\nWhile trying to narrowly avoid [inner emigration](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inner_emigration), I‚Äôve put myself on a full press embargo after the months of frenzy leading up to the US Presidential Election: I‚Äôm terrified that the 24 hour news cycle is designed only to distract, and there‚Äôs very little to distinguish honest journalism from partisan hackery in the echo chambers we‚Äôve spent the last few years building for ourselves.\n\nSo I read some fuckin books.\n\n### Fiction\n\nI read three pieces of fiction this year that stand out. None were published any time recently. They have with very little to do with one another, save for that _Flow My Tears‚Ä¶_ and _Cat‚Äôs Cradle_ could loosely be thrown into the Science Fiction section at a used bookstore and no crime would have been committed, and I enjoyed each one of them for entirely different reasons.\n\n* [_Flow My Tears, the Policeman Said_][tears] by Philip K. Dick ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÜ\n\nPhilip K. Dick often wrote about  men who suddenly find themselves out of place, where their underlying assumptions about the world are either slowly subverted if not turned entirely upside down. _Flow My Tears‚Ä¶_ is one of the latter.\n\n* [_Cat‚Äôs Cradle_: A Novel][cats] by Kurt Vonnegut ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ\n\nKurt Vonnegut knows how to keep things brief and always remembers to include a punchline. And there‚Äôs a main character in this book with the same last name as me, go figure why I liked it. You should read this, it‚Äôs short and funny and leaves you thinking about big questions about humanity. And Ice-9.\n\n* [_American Gods_][gods] by Neil Gaiman ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÜ\n\nNeil Gaiman is not an author that I‚Äôve ever really gotten into. He seems like a soft spoken British man who spins somewhat boring stories infused with ‚Äúmagick‚Äù and ‚Äúfaeries‚Äô or something like that, right? Either way, I was probably quick to judge Gaiman on his observable aesthetic and film adaptations. American Gods is great.\n\nMore importantly, these three works bring into question the notion of identity: in _Flow My Tears‚Ä¶_, the protagonists celebrity identity is stripped away in an instant with no explanation; _Cat‚Äôs Cradle_ centers around a group of people failing to understand each other and their means of relating to the world, all while foolishly toying with scientific advances that carry devastating consequences; finally, American Gods serves as modern mythology-cum-Bildungsroman and is about a character literally named ‚ÄúShadow‚Äù who‚Äôs piecing together his present version of himself from fractured memories of his past life while struggling to separate reality from fantasy or illusion.\n\nPhew, ok, that was a mouthful. On with the rest of the list.\n\n### Non-Fiction\n\nLast year‚Äôs wrap up post was assembled in a hurry, and while I certainly had chosen a few vectors in my non-fiction selections, I had of course done it somewhat haphazardly. I largely discovered the things on my 2015 list myself by way of the internet. In 2016 I went about it a bit differently\u003csup\u003e2\u003c/sup\u003e and I‚Äôm pleased with the results.\n\n* [_Fire in the Valley_: The Birth and Death of the Personal Computer][fire] by Michael Swaine and Paul Freiberger ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ\n\nIf you work in tech, read this book. [See previously](2016-reading-list.html#fire-in-the-valley-details)\n\n* [_Incerto_][incerto] by Nassim Nicholas Taleb ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ\n\t* _Fooled By Randomness_\n\t* _The Black Swan_\n\t* _Antifragile_\n\nThe last thing I expected to find this year was yet another author to do a deep-dive into, but Nassim Taleb is my man this year. I picked up Antifragile in February based off of Joe‚Äôs glowing recommendation. I had recalled seeing the covers of Fooled By Randomness and The Black Swan in bookstores in recent years, but I glibly assumed that they were of the Malcom Gladwell variety of disposable pop-science / psychology non ficton, full of bluster and anecdote but otherwise lacking in anything concrete. Similar to the genre of business books, but for people who think they‚Äôre smarter than people who read business books.\n\nBoy was I wrong.\n\nFull of bluster: yes. Taleb is absurdly bumptious, but in a way that I find endearing. Lacking in content: hardly. The only similarity to cheapie business books is some of the repetitiveness in the arguments being presented, but that‚Äôs at best a superficial criticism. I poured through _Antifragile_, the cumulative argument in the [_Incerto_][incerto] series, but the the prologue assured me that I wouldn‚Äôt need to read the previous three volumes as a prerequisite to grokking the subject matter.\n\nAfter reading _Antifragile_ I let its ideas stew in my brain for a few months, as I dug through other non-fiction in nearby fields and concepts, particularly by Niall Ferguson. But _Antifragile_ kept on bugging me. I wanted to re-read it.\n\nThe fundamental asymmetries that exist between what we think we know and everything else in the universe, and we‚Äôre hardwired to misinterpret events. As a species we excel at _predicting the past_ and are generally terrible at keeping score when we make predictions about the future ‚Äî and our past losses can always be  summarized in convenient and intelligent-sounding justifications.\n\nAround that same time I started following Nassim Taleb on twitter (worth it) and that he had recently published [_Incerto_][incerto] as a handsome box of paperbacks. Sold. Also gave as a gift to a few smartypants people I know.\n\nPresented as a series of essays, anecdotes, and diatribes, with copious footnotes and even a technical essay or two, _Fooled By Randomness_, _The Black Swan_, and _Antifragile_ just about made my anti-academic year, and are now prized possessions on my bookshelf. I look forward to finishing _Bed of Procrustes_ this year and to re-reading the series again in the future. I‚Äôve never encountered so many powerful and challenging ideas all in one place. It‚Äôs a piece of non-fiction that begs to be read for pleasure over and over again, just like a good sci-fi or fantasy series would. Amazing.\n\n## Up / Down\n\nCold, meaningless ratings.\n\n* Science Fiction / Fantasy\n\t* _The Three Body Problem_ by Cixin Liu ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÜ\n\t* _The Killing Moon_ by N.K.

File ownership and content exportability are typically the first rights you wave to operate in someone else‚Äôs walled garden.

The Lord loves a working man\n2. Don't trust whitey\n3. See a doctor and get rid of it\n\n**This is universally good advice.**\n\nI may not believe in any higher power, but showing up and being willing to get your hands dirty gives you more advantages than not.\n\nI may not be anything other than an average white american man, but I sure as hell don't trust any authority figure. It's a reasonable precautionary measure.\n\nAnd I may not follow all good advice, but seriously you should see a doctor every once in a while. And call your mom.\n\nI first saw these painted on a plaque in a tattoo shop in Boulder, completely removed from their context in The Jerk, which I had already seen but didn't connect at the time. I had remembered the signage despite missing the connection to the film. I re-watched it last week and finally noticed, and reveled in the warmth of a pop-culture reference coming full circle: it was a moment of life's weird interconnected on full display. I spent a lot of time in that tattoo shop.\n\nWhat difficult-to-ignore advice has influenced you?\n\n[imdb]: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0079367/\n","permalink":"writing/lessons-from-the-jerk.html","title":"Lessons from The Jerk","updatedAt":"2017-04-24T06:19:52.000Z"},{"slug":"picking-up-the-pieces","path":"src/posts/picking-up-the-pieces.md","body":"## Picking up the pieces; or How I learned to stop worrying and embrace weird metaphors\n\nMetaphors are fractals of language: once you start to examine them closely, you end up seeing the same pattern over and over and over again.\n\nI tend to find myself re-using the same (usually tired) metaphors in all sorts of different situations. But let's not chalk it up to laziness right away. Once I start seeing a particular pattern that's useful for solving problems, well, as they (I) say, I've found my hammer, and everything becomes a nail.\u003csup\u003e[1](#picking-up-the-pieces-01)\u003c/sup\u003e\n\n**Helpful Metaphors**\n\nTravel metaphors are always useful, bringing in words like eyeline, takeoff, and landing into conversations makes work feel more like a swashbuckling adventure than a boring slog through a checklist.\n\nEggs rolling towards the edge of a table is a particularly good image I've borrowed from Matt Work. It's so damn useful when you need show how to deal with decision overload. \"There are a dozen eggs rolling toward the edge of the table. You can only catch one.\"\n\nIt's an argument against micromanagement and interventionism, while offering practical advice for most types of people wrangling problems.\n\n\u003cspan class=\"f1 tc dib w-100\"\u003eüç≥\u003c/span\u003e\n\n**Unhelpful Metaphors**\n\nHave you ever found yourself saying the back half of a sentence in which you've been using an obtuse or random metaphor to summarize a situation, and you realize that your captive audience is making a face because you are in the middle of a cognitive leap so bizarre it would make an anti-comedian blush? Me too.\n\nI call that an \"unhelpful metaphor.\" Even if it does make sense without being a stretch, if it makes the poor audience question the sanity of the speaker it's safe to say it should probably be left out.\n\n**Finding balance**\n\nUsually when I start employing these colorful turns of phrase it's because I'm trending to frame a concept, and I'm using roughly hewn idioms in an imprecise language to do it. Like how a charcoal rubbing brings out the detail hidden to the naked eye, an applicable metaphor, however weird, can help drawn out a details that might not be readily apparent.\n\nSo these days I just say it, whether or not it's a weird comparison. I'm lending my point of view, and in a subjective world, the sooner you understand someone's perspective, the sooner you'l be able to establish empathy.\n\n\u003caside\u003e\n  \u003col\u003e\n    \u003cli id=\"picking-up-the-pieces-01\"\u003eOk.

It's a fun side-project done over a couple weekends. There‚Äôs a big difference.\n\nIt's not a blog because it's not using any blogging software, per-se, just some elbow grease and [a few scripts][1] that I've to cobbled together into a mostly-working, glue‚Äìand‚Äìpopsicle-sticks publishing platform.\n\nSimple products are fashionable these days, especially when it comes to media consumption. Even I've been known to write a Medium post upon occasion, but I didn't set out to build this as a monument to simplicity. This isn't that type of place and I'm not that type of fella; things are always a bit messier than that in real life.\n\nSo as it stands, this is just a barely functioning, loosely coherent website with weird cursor effects\u003csup\u003e[1][footnote1]\u003c/sup\u003e (unless I've gotten bored and removed them) and superfluous footnotes\u003csup\u003e[2][footnote2]\u003c/sup\u003e (I probably haven't removed these.)\n\n\u003e So why go through all the trouble to build this in the first place? Why not just use Medium?\n\nIsn't this what all developers inevitably do anyway? Build some crappy knock-off of good software because they're ego is too big to use anything that's not been graced to have sprung unbidden from their god-like cheeto-covered fingertips? Yes, let's all create something second rate instead of using something off-the-shelf in order to scratch the proverbial itch? Why, yes. Yes, it's probably something like that then.\n\nThe question might as well then become, \"why build anything at all?\"\n\n**I made this because it was fun.**\n\nIt was more fun figuring out how to [easily inline all the assets][2] and [strip out unused css][3] on this page than it would have been to set up Wordpress again. The first time I ever set up Wordpress in 2008 was a magical and transformative experience, so why am I so quick to shun it now? Am I really that self-important? Wordpress is great software and I can't make anything that comes close to it in a weekend.\n\n\u003e Doing something from scratch, even if it's not polished, doesn't deny or invalidate what you've done in the past.\n\nFor a long time I refused to do any writing on my website because I felt like I didn't have the time. I was afraid that anything I wrote would be bad and then I'd be committed to it forever, comma splices and all. Paranoia that I would look back on it later with utter embarrassment kept me from committing to much writing since I killed my [first blog][5] in 2008. What I guess I means is I'm over that now? [Worse is better][4] after all, so why not let the tap start flowing!\n\nIn keeping with that spirit, I've shoddily rebuild an ode to Jekyll so that I can have reasonable writing experience for myself, which means markdown and not much else to fuss over. I'm unburdened by the need for SEO or any other unspeakable non-sense, but I care about mobile web and I care about pagespeed so I've gone and done the aforementioned asset inlining, which I think has come out quite nicely.\n\n**Go out and make something, even if it's a shoddy facsimile of something else.**\n\nWhat are you going to make for yourself?\n\np.s.
